# Coding pattern preferences

- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested 
- When fixing an issue or a bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. If you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we do not have a duplicate logic.
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized 
- Avoid writing scripts in files, especially when the script is going to be run only once 
- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code, refactor at that point.
- Mocking data is only needed for tests, never mock for dev or prod.
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the prod or dev environment.
- Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming.---
